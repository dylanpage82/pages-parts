# Pages Part Store
Pages Parts is a part store website that allows you to brouse parts and look at the description of the part. If you sign-up and login you will gain access to edit the part information, delete the part, and add new parts to inventory.

### Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDB, JSX, Node.js

## Getting started

## Next steps
I would like to build in a search bar that takes you to the show page of the part you type in. I would also like to make it to were there are two log-ins one for the general user to buy and shop and another for the admin to edit the website
